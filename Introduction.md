# Introduction

## What is Python?
From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language))
>Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace. It provides constructs that enable clear programming on both small and large scales.

Python is widely used in web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and scientific computing. It is the most popular environment in the data science field. In fact, the strong growth of python popularity over the last few years is said to be largely driven by growing usage of machine learning 

## Why Python over Excel?
While Excel has its obvious advantages (especially easy viewing and visualising), it proves to be inefficient when dealing with large amounts of data. Python appears to be the solution for Excel's drawbacks.
- Efficiency
  - Processing data in Python is by far quicker. It can also deal with very large tables (>1M).
- Repeatability
  - Once you have written a script you can run it over and over again. It might take longer to initially write the process in python, but it will take one click to rerun it against an updated set of data.
- Transparency and sharing
  - You can easily cooperate on the same process and share your ideas for approaching data.
- Flexibility
  - Python is a much larger tool than Excel. Aside from processing data, you can also employ it in other areas such as machine learning.
- Knowledge building
  - There is only so many data processes you do. Sharing ideas and collaborating on code development with other people will mean that over time, writing new data processes in Python will eventually become very quick and easy.
