# Data types and operators

## Basic data types

Alike Excel, you have various data types that you can use in Python. In Excel there are types such as floats, integers, booleans (True/False), texts, date and currency.

Python has 7 basic data types: integers, floats, booleans, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries. Most of them are quite analogical to Excel, though some of them are more advanced.

| Data Type  | Example | Applications |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| integer  | 61  | indexing, counting, very simple calculations  |
| float  | 3.14  | calculations  |
| boolean  | True (False)  | comparisons, 'if' statements  |
| string  | 'Sky Sports', 'Apple'  | working with text  |
| list  | [2, 5, -10, 100]  | storing sequences of data  |
| tuple  | (1, 2, 5, -8)  | storing sequences of data provided you don't want to change them, returning values  |
| dictionary  | {'Kane': 48, 'Messi': 45, 'Ronaldo': 44, 'Lewandowski':48}  | Looking up on data  |

## Operators

Python features a range of operators. They can be split into arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, assignment operators and bitwise operators.

#### Arithmetic operators

| Operator  | Example | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| +  | 3 + 2 (outcome: 5) | addition |
| -  | 3 - 1 (outcome: 2) | subtraction |
| *  | 3 * 2 (outcome: 6) | multiplication |
| /  | 9 / 3 (outcome: 3) | division |
| **  | 2 ** 3 (outcome: 8) | power calculation |
| //  | 9 // 2 (outcome: 4) | floor division |
| %  | 9 % 2 (outcome: 1) | modulus |
