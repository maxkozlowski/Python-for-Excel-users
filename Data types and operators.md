# Data types and operators

## Basic data types

Alike Excel, you have various data types that you can use in Python. In Excel there are types such as floats, integers, booleans (True/False), texts, date and currency.

Python has 7 basic data types: integers, floats, booleans, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries. Most of them are quite analogical to Excel, though some of them are more advanced.

| Data Type  | Example | Applications |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| integer  | 61  | indexing, counting, very simple calculations  |
| float  | 3.14  | calculations  |
| boolean  | True (False)  | comparisons, 'if' statements  |
| string  | 'Sky Sports', 'Apple'  | working with text  |
| list  | [2, 5, -10, 100]  | storing sequences of data  |
| tuple  | (1, 2, 5, -8)  | storing sequences of data provided you don't want to change them, returning values  |
| dictionary  | {'Kane': 48, 'Messi': 45, 'Ronaldo': 44, 'Lewandowski':48}  | Looking up on data  |

## Operators

Python features a range of operators. They can be split into arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, identity, membership and bitwise operators.

| Category  | Operator  | Example | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| arithmetic  | +  | 3 + 2 (outcome: 5) | addition |
| arithmetic  | -  | 3 - 1 (outcome: 2) | subtraction |
| arithmetic  | *  | 3 * 2 (outcome: 6) | multiplication |
| arithmetic  | /  | 9 / 3 (outcome: 3) | division |
| arithmetic  | **  | 2 ** 3 (outcome: 8) | power calculation |
| arithmetic  | //  | 9 // 2 (outcome: 4) | floor division |
| arithmetic  | %  | 9 % 2 (outcome: 1) | modulus |
| arithmetic  | =  | x = 10 | x = 10 |
| assignment  | +=  | x += 10 | x = x + 10 |
| assignment  | -=  | x-=10 | x = x - 10 |
| assignment  | * =  | x * = 10 | x = x * 10 |
| assignment  | /=  | x /= 10 | x = x / 10 |
| assignment  | ** =  | x ** = 10 | x = x ** 10 |
| assignment  | //=  | x //= 10 | x = x // 10 |
| assignment  | %=  | x %= 10 | x = x % 10 |
| comparison  | ==  | x == y | check if equal |
| comparison  | !=  | x != y | check if not equal |
| comparison  | >  | x > y | check if greater than |
| comparison  | <  | x < y | check if less than |
| comparison  | >=  | x >= y | check if greater than or equal to |
| comparison  | <=  | x <= y | check if less than or equal to |
| logical  | and  | x == y and x < z | check if both statements are true |
| logical  | or  | x == y or x < z | check if at least one of the statements is true |
| logical  | not  | not x == y | return the reverse result |
| identity  | is  | x is y | check if the viables are the same objects |
| identity  | is not  | x is not y | check if the variables are different objects |
| membership  | in  | x in y | check if the variable can be found in the specified sequence |
| membership  | not in  | x not in y | check if the variable can not be found in the specified sequence |
