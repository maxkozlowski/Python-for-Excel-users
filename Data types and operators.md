# Data types and operators

## Basic data types

Alike Excel, you have various data types that you can use in Python. In Excel there are types such as floats, integers, booleans (True/False), texts, date and currency.

Python has 7 basic data types: integers, floats, booleans, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries. Most of them are quite analogical to Excel, though some of them are more advanced.

| Data Type  | Example | Applications |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| integer  | 61  | indexing, counting, very simple calculations  |
| float  | 3.14  | calculations  |
| boolean  | True (False)  | comparisons, 'if' statements  |
| string  | 'Sky Sports', 'Apple'  | working with text  |
| list  | [2, 5, -10, 100]  | storing sequences of data  |
| tuple  | (1, 2, 5, -8)  | storing sequences of data provided you don't want to change them, returning values  |
| dictionary  | {'Kane': 48, 'Messi': 45, 'Ronaldo': 44, 'Lewandowski':48}  | Looking up on data  |
