# Methods

## Methods vs functions

A Python method is like a function but it is embedded in the object and it works for the object. Methodes are created and used to perform a specific task on a particular, signle object. Working with methods is very similar to working with functions.

```python
# Upper method that works on a string object
my_name = 'Max'
my_name = my_name.upper()
my_name
```

As you can see in the example above, to call a method you first type the object you want to use it on and add the name of the method you want to call after a dot. 

## Useful methods

Python has a range of useful built in methods. Because methods will work with specific objects it makes sense to group them by data types.

#### Methods for Strings

```python
object.lower()
```

Converts characters to lowercase.

```python
object.proper()
```

Converts characters to propercase.

```python
object.upper()
```

Converts characters to uppercase.

```python
object.strip()
```

Removes leading and trailing whitespaces. Analogical to trim in Excel.

```python
object.replace(old, new)
```

Replaces old substring with a new substring.

```python
object.split(sub)
```

Splits a string based on the substring provided and converts it to a list.

```python
object.endswith(sub)
```

Checks if string ends with substring sub.

```python
object.startswith(sub)
```

Checks if string starts with substring sub.

```python
object.find(sub)
```

Returns the lowest index of the string where substring sub is found. If substring sub can not found -1 is returned.

```python
object.rfind(sub)
```

Returns the highest index of the string where substring sub is found. If substring sub can not found -1 is returned.

```python
object.count(sub)
```

Returns the number of occurrences of substring sub found in the string.

#### Methods for Lists

```python
object.append(x)
```

Add an item x to the end of the list.

```python
object.remove(x)
```

Remove the first item from the list whose value is equal to x.

```python
object.count(x)
```

Return the number of times x appears in the list.

```python
object.reverse()
```

Reverse the elements of the list in place.

#### Methods for Dictionaries

```python
object.keys()
```

Return a view of the dictionary’s keys.

```python
object.values()
```

Return a new view of the dictionary’s values.
